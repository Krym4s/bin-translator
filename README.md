# bin-translator

It is the last project of first course of university. This project is JIT-compiler for my assembler from first semestr. (Assembler was changed because it does not worked on Linux).

This project has several goals
- Discover structure of elf file and create own minimum elf file for x86-64 
- Compare speed of working of processor emulator from first semestr and real processor running programm
- Make optimizations for Processor
